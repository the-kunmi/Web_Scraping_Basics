## Web Scraping Practice Repository

Welcome to my Web Scraping Practice Repository! This repository is a collection of projects I worked on while learning and improving my web scraping skills. Each project represents a different aspect of web scraping, from basic data extraction to more complex automation tasks.

## 📌 About This Repository
I started learning web scraping to enhance my data collection and analysis skills, which are crucial for business intelligence and analytics. This repository serves as a documentation of my journey, showcasing various practice projects I undertook to sharpen my skills.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
Throughout my learning process, I have used different tools and libraries, including:
- **Python** – The primary programming language used for scripting.
- **Selenium** – For automating browser interactions and extracting dynamic content.
- **BeautifulSoup** – For parsing HTML and extracting structured data.
- **Requests** – For making HTTP requests to retrieve web pages.
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation and storage.
